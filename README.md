# enos

Some code I wrote while playing around with core.async.

## What's with the name?

It's named after the character Enos from the Dukes of Hazzard. For obvious reasons.

## Status

If write software for controlling nuclear reactors, you should
immediately rush to incorporate this library into safety-critical
applications.
